React Portfolio

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a Professional Portfolio for prospetive employers to view my sample works. The webpage has the following sections: 
1. About me section 
2. Presentation of my sample works 
3. Resume
4. My Contact details

The skills that I applied to build out the portfolio were: 
- React Component Structure: Understanding how to organise components in a React application
- Use of JSX (JavaScript XML)
- React Router: use of React Router for managing different routes within the application
- Mantine Components: use of Mantine UI components to build the application
